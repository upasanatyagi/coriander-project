                Unfortunately all of our cakes presently contain wheat, eggs and
                dairy. Whilst all do not contain nuts we do use nuts in our
                kitchen. I am currently working on a vegan menuâ€¦please ask!

                Dependent on seasonal availability and I would be delighted to
                arrange these on your cake for you.
